## Intro to ml5 examples

If you've looked at our [quickstart](/getting-started/) and [introduction to ml5](/getting-started/hello-ml5), you will have dipped your toes into the ml5 universe.

<br/>

A big part of the ml5 project is to create lots of examples as launching points for all your creative project ideas. You can find all of the ml5.js examples at out Github page: [ml5-examples](https://github.com/ml5js/ml5-examples). If you start to explore these examples you can see how the different ml5 functions are used to accomplish different outcomes. We try our best to keep the examples as simple as possible so you can easily start to build your ideas on top of them.
